Welcome to the wiki for ATS2.

The most recent released version of ATS2 is ATS2-0.1.5.

The programming language ATS is a statically typed language with a type system rooted in the framework Applied Type System. ATS unifies implementation with formal specification by accommodating a programmer-centric approach to program verification: How do we know a program being implemented correctly? We ask the programmer to demonstrate it with a proof.

The official website of ATS is at [http://ats-lang.org][1], which is built using ATS itself. For a thorough introduction to ATS, please see the book *[Introduction to Programming in ATS][3]* and *[A Tutorial on Programming Features in ATS][4]*. Also, there is a [google-group-forum][2] for discussing any and all the issues on or related to ATS.
