ATS has many facilities that enable effective, efficient, and [[safe|safety]] scientific computing. The language's focus on safety and efficiency is obvious, but actually making efficient scientific code is often far from easy (in any language).


## Parallel programming
* [OpenMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP)

## Optimization
* Linear and convex optimization (Gurobi)

## Python [[code generation|code generation]]
Python is perhaps one of the most popular general scientific computing languages, alongside MATLAB, though the R language has a notable lead with available statistics software (particular in Biology).

## Matrix operations
Efficient matrix operations are difficult in practice.

### Native ATS2 matrix algebra implementations

### BLAS interfaces
(none yet?)
