ATS has many facilities that enable effective, efficient, and safe scientific computing. The language's focus on safety and efficiency is obvious, but actually making efficient scientific code is often far from easy (in any language).


## Parallel programming
* [OpenMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP)

## Optimization
* Linear and convex optimization (Gurobi)

## Python code generation
Python is perhaps one of the most popular general scientific computing languages, alongside MATLAB, though the R language has a notable lead with available statistics software (particular in Biology).
