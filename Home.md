Welcome to the wiki for ATS2.

The most recent released version of ATS2 is ATS2-0.1.1.

The programming language ATS is a statically typed language with a type system rooted in the framework **A**pplied **T**ype **S**ystem. ATS unifies specification and implementation by accommodating a programmer-centric approach to program verification: How do we know a program being implemented correctly? We ask the programmer to demonstrate it with a proof.

ATS also has another [website][1] (built using ATS itself). For a thorough introduction to ATS, see the book *[Introduction to Programming in ATS][2]*.
